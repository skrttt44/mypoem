~The Fantastic Poem~

My poem is fantastic
  Don't even hasitate
If you find this sarcastic, 
  It means you have no taste.

My poem is so excellent,
  Just have a read and see,
How beautiful and eloquent
  It is indeed, agree?

My poem is so brilliant
  Because I have a gift
Of being awfully resilient
  To every hit and whift 
  
  Writing this poem was a lot of fun for me. I haven't written any poems, I think, in ages! 
  I wrote this poem to show the fun and creative side of me and to practice using Git and
  GitHub. I hope this humble project not only demonstrates my artistry but also proves
  I can easily learn, master and utilize new technologies and tools.
